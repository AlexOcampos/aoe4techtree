                Some have complained about the advanced stats section which is
                too shiny (some even threatened to report me for destroying his
                corneas ðŸ¤£). Your wishes are orders to me.

              <p>
                I have modify the color palette. I hope it improves the user
                experience of the website. If you still don't like it, please

                I added a widget to receive support. As you know the website has
                several expenses (server, domain, ...). Due to the success of
                the page last month I receive an unexpected bill from the server
                provider (we exceed the bandwidth rate). I made the 1.1.1
                version to avoid this in the future, but I have to pay the bill
                anyway this month. I hope with your help to keep the project
                alive.

                resources in the same server. Netlify free account has a
                bandwidth limit of 100GB/month and I'm going over the limit, so
